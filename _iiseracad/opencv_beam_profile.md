description: >
    As part of a lab course on optics, I needed a way to profile diffraction patterns automatically The solution attempted was to capture the pattern with a camera, and use Python-OpenCV to extract the beam profile along an axis.

The beam profile is plotted in PyGame using a library I coded, and subsequently misplaced :/
