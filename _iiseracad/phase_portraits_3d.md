description: >
    I developed software to simulate the motion of particles in a three dimensional field, and plot their trajectories IRL, towards my project work on non-linear dynamics. It was coded in Python, uses Pygame for visualization, and the Euler method for simulating a lorentz attractor specified in the default set of equations. It is quite flexible, and allows the user to spray points on the canvas and watch them evolve according to the specified equations governing the trajectory.
