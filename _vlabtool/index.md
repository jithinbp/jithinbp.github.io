    This USB powered Unit plugs into your computer and lets you study a wide range of phenomena. The built in measurement capabilities include an oscilloscope, a frequency counter, and a  logic analyzer among other things. It also includes precise sine/triangle/square waveform generators, as well as several programmable voltage and current sources. Add-on boards, both wired as well as wireless, enable measurement of physical parameters ranging from acceleration and angular velocity, to luminous intensity and Passive Infrared. PC based software aggregates all the above and hosts innovative experiments.
