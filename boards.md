# Other Microcontrollers

The kuttypy bootloader command set can be extended to support other boards as well, without losing
capabilities. Thus far, two boards other than the [original KuttyPy based on Atmega32](../) have been tested.

+ Arduino Uno R3
+ Arduino Nano

### Arduino Uno R3

Basic I/O controls and I2C sensors have been implemented. Work needs to be done to properly support PWM, ADCs etc.
