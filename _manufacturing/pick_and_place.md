### Manufacturing video

During the batch manufacturing of [KuttyPy Plus](https://csparkresearch.in/kuttypyplus) , I filmed all the important bits. Check out the [video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/9xXyL25D2jo?si=7kIOSDi9OaepTCWc){:target="_blank"}.

The PCBs are ordered from CIPSA-TEC in Karnataka, and they also provide the stencil in a metal frame. 

I then take these and all the components to Beam Infotech in Gurgaon which was earlier located in Mayapuri before demonetisation almost ran them into the ground. The proprietors are quite friendly, and allow me to use their fully automated line for 2 days within which all my work on PCB assembly is completed.

Seen above is the robot which assembles everything on solder paste pattern, and an image of the first board with some clear offset errors. I pause the line for about ten minutes till the first panel passes all checks. Then it is free to run till the end of day.

### Testing and Calibration

### Other pick and place machines

The factory also had a cool machine for placing through hole resistors.
