Simple text based configuration file can be used to generate a graphical control screen. The mnemonics need to be mapped to the corresponding GPIB addresses on linux-gpib running on the server. Adding an optional 'display' argument activates a display field in the GUI

JQuery-UI based widgets can be dragged around and repositioned. Interconnects can be made by dragging labels and dropping them on targets. The GUI also enables a real-time camera feed.

This web based application allows users to quickly set up data acquisition rigs on a web-browser that remotely interfaces with scientific instruments connected to the web server.

I wrote the backend on Python which uses CherryPy to host webpages as well as real-time data from instruments.  OpenCV is used to read the data stream from a webcam, and Python-gpib (a wrapper for linux-gpib) interfaces with GPIB dongles.

The Jquery-AJAX based frontend serves as a primitive programming interface. Iâ€™ve included support for variables as well as a few loops.  Plotting is carried out using flot.jquery. This was how I started out with JQuery, and JS in general, and a lot of good open-source platforms for webapps have emerged since. therefore, this project stands abandoned.
