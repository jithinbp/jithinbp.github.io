## One giant voltage multiplier

Just clicked some photos. The university has a really old particle acceleration with the voltage doubling ladder left intact. The drums are capacitors, and the connecting rods are diodes. Stuff is filled with paraffin [wax, to insulate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPiel_jUow4).


The basement is where the experiments are conducted.

## High activity sources
