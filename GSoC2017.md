Project Abstract : Develop firmware and experiments for Pocket Science Lab (PSLab)
===

---

Characteristic of a shift into the digital era, students have started to learn to code at an early age. However, most of the academic applications are currently centered around purely software based learning techniques such as simulations.
The ability to easily access multiple control and measurement tools as well as analyze the results from one common platform (such as is common in advanced research labs ) enables students to design new experiments and further the spirit of science.

The Pocket Science lab is such a platform precisely, and its architecture makes it an affordable tool for the masses, that has the potential to nurture young scientists.

Over this summer, I was happy to be able to work on the Pocket Science Lab project with Fossasia.
It has been a learning experience in collaborative editing, and I worked with several frameworks such as EmberJS, Flask, Jekyll, and PyQt, and also got acquainted with platforms such as Heroku and Surge.sh .
During the course of this programme, I wrote 15 blog posts outlining my work, and these are listed in the next section.

Progress report

For GSoC-17, I worked on several aspects of the [Pocket Science Lab](https://pslab.fossasia.org) Project:
---

* [Desktop Applications](https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-desktop-apps):
---
The PSLab desktop applications consist of a range of PyQt based graphical utilities and apps that allow users to carry out a range of experiments. They rely on [PyQtGraph](http://www.pyqtgraph.org/) for visualization of data, and [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) and [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) for data analysis. The package uses pslab-python repository for communicating with the hardware.
  * Documenting several apps using Jekyll to render markdown files via templates. Docs for a few apps are still pending.
  * Cross checked a range of experiments and collected data.
  * Created screenshots, and made several schematics for documentation.
  * Added applications to calibrate the pslab using ADS1115 16-bit ADC module.

  ---

* [Remote Laboratory](https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-remote):
---
The remote laboratory is essentially an EmberJS webapp paired with a Python-Flask API server that allows users to write and execute python scripts via the internet or local network. In the progress I have made so far, users can create accounts, and write a variety of Python scripts whose console output will be shown on the webapp. A framework for object oriented scripts is under development, and users are currently able to create button widgets, and relay the results of their callbacks to graphs as well as labels.
  * Please refer to the [README](https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-remote/blob/master/README.md) on how to setup your own server.
  * I Created an API server with python flask, and Postgresql. A live copy is hosted on [Heroku](https://pslab-stage.herokuapp.com) . A real PSLab hardware device is not connected to the server, and a dummy class is being used instead.
  * Created a webapp made with [EmberJS](https://www.emberjs.com/) . A demo of the webapp hosted on [Surge.sh](https://pslab-remote.surge.sh).
    * Sign-up is not necessary; a demo account may be used; username: a@a.com , password:a 
    * Heroku reaps free dynos after an hour of inactivity, so the backend may take up to 10 seconds to boot up and respond to the first request.

  ---

* [Python Communication Library](https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-python)
---
This is a communication library written in Python that contains all the methods used to interact with the pocket science lab.
  * Made bug fixes in capture calls.
  * Assisted the android team to understand the various function calls during the porting process
  * Added support for several new add-on modules such as ADS1115, SX1278 LoRa module, MPU925x 10-DOF IMU sensor among others.  
  * My Contribution: [Pull Requests](https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-python/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20author%3Ajithinbp), [commits](https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-python/commits/?author=jithinbp), [issues](https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-python/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20author%3Ajithinbp)
  ---

* [Firmware Development of the PSLab](https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-firmware)
---
The firmware is essentially a large state machine that squeezes out almost all capabilities of the central microcontroller of the Pocket Science Lab, a PIC24E series chip from Microchip Technology.
  * Wrote code for PIC24E processor with MPLab IDE and compiled with XC16 compiler.
  * Wrote the state machine for PSLab and uploaded the same during the proposal stage of GSoC-17.
  * My Contribution: [Pull Requests](https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-firmware/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20author%3Ajithinbp), [commits](https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-firmware/commits/master?author=jithinbp), [issues](https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-firmware/issues/?author=jithinbp)
  ---

* [Hardware Design](https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-hardware) :
---
The PSLab hardware is a 4 layer circuit board designed with [KiCAD](kicad-pcb.org) which is an excellent open-source EDA. The hardware has a minimal bill of materials, and combines a powerful 64MHz microcontroller with a range of analog peripherals such as programmable amplifiers, Op-Amps, buffers, crystals etc.
  * Designed with [KiCAD](http://kicad-pcb.org/).
  * I also manufactured the device and supplied it to co-developers for development and testing.
