Photo of the setup designed with FreeCAD and printed on a BambuLabs P1S. The magnet holder wasn't symmetric enough, so I redesigned it later.

The setup gave 3 clean sine waves with almost 120 degree phase difference between each. The small error can be attributed to mounting the coils
in their sockets which have some tolerance.
