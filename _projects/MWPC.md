description: >
  Designed in KiCAD, this is an MWPC I made for charged particle detection. The top side has equally spaced wires of 20 micro thickness, with L-C chain connecting them. On either ends I have placed preamplifier circuits as well as high speed trigger signal generators. The backplane also consists of wires maintained at a high voltage.

I soldered 20 micron thick wires meant for cellphone LCD display repair. They're meant to separate the glass layers, and are quite strong.

### MWPC by Dr Saneesh

Saneesh from IUAC built this MWPC with delay line ICs from Rhombus instead of the L-C ladder I built. It is much more sophisticated, and has been tested in the beam line.
