  Developed for a student project, this meter has an LED and a linear light sensor to monitor the growth of bateria in an innoculated medium. An ESP32 relays the luminosity measurements to my server via MQTT

## Automatic cell plate reader

Repurposed a benchtop CNC as a cell plate reader using Python and GCode
