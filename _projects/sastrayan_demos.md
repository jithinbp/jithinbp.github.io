### Made a bunch of demos at the dept of physics for an open house event.

+ Experiments with High voltage : Tesla Coil Costs 5K rs and comes with 2 small gas filled bulbs : [Buy on amazon](https://www.amazon.in/Home-PV-Speaker-Science-Experimental/dp/B0D7DKF2WM?tag=jithinbp-21)

+ Gas discharge tubes : Bought a set of 18 different  tubes for 9.5K and a power supply for another 4K
Volunteers demonstrated discharge glows, and also showed the discharge spectra using a portable spectrometer.

+ Fiber optic showpiece : The fiber toy(100rs from a roadside vendor) was plugged into a portable spectrometer(eye watering 1.7L from Ocean Optics) to demonstrate spectrum different colours. 

+ Optics demos : Used optics kit designed by Makerspace Belgaum to show converging and diverging beams. (Free from Praveen and Gautam at Makerspace Belgaum)

+ Spectrometer dismantling : Opened up a Perkin Elmer spectrometer with the  Visible Lamp on, to show the various parts. Thank you Pradyummnan sir .

+ Time of flight : Measure time taken for an object in free fall by using SEELab3 , and verify S=0.5*g*t^2

+ Sensors : Showed pressure, temperature and IMU sensors with SEELab. measure time period of a pendulum using the gyroscope sensor.

+ [3 Phase AC generator](/projects/3phaseAC/) : 3D printed and designed with FreeCAD. Readings taken with SEELab3 for a magnet spinning at the centre of 3 coils at 120 degrees

+ DiodeIV vs Temperature : SEELab3 IV characteristics in 3D . Used a lighter to heat diode and observe change in knee voltage.

+ Magnetic field gradient : Raster scan a magnetometer to plot field lines. Used a laser engraver for the XY gantry, and an HMC5883L magnetometer with SEELab3.

+ Thermodynamics : Expanding balloon inside a transparent vacuum chamber (Dessicator)

+ Sound : Show FFT of sound. Convert an image to sound and reconstruct it.
