## Overview of Ananth Venkatesan sir's lab.

The neighbours have a refrigerator that’s guarded 24×7 by a grad student in spite of the fact that there never is any ice cream in it.

It can cool its contents to around 10mK , subject to heat load .
Designed by Oxford Instruments, this dilution refrigerator uses a mixture of He-4 and its isotope He-3 to achieve such low temperatures. It’s a closed system (He-3 isn’t cheap :p) , and the liquefiers and compressors are situated in a chamber adjacent to the lab.

The research carried out using this setup deals mostly with mesoscopic devices such as nanomechanical resonators. IISER Mohali also has several fabrication facilities.

My neighbor from the dorm worked on this before shipping off to Pisa. The PI firmly believed I was a menace but let me borrow stuff like a fancy leak detector from Adixen to test my DIY probes and chambers. :)
