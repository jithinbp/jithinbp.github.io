description: >
    Tried DC sputtering and annealing to make a thin film of a potential topological insulator Sodium Irridate on Yttrium Aluminate substrate. Had fun and failed spectacularly.

## Conclusion

Towards the end of this process, a scanning electron microscope with EDS was installed.  The EDS data revealed that the thin films produced were actually IrO3.
