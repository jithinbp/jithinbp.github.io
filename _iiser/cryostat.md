A pictorial walkthrough of the installation of the He-4 based Cryostat at the SpinLab, IISER Mohali.  This cryostat is equipped with a 3-axis vector magnet and a dynamic VTI capable of cooling samples down to 2 Kelvin.


## Installation of the cryostat

The cryostat was lowered into the pit with a pulley. Also shown is the safely valve at the bottom in case a magnet quenches
or the nitrogen boil off outlets get clogged. After precooling with LN2, the Liquid Helium Dewar is used to fill the cryostat

Letting off excess pressure from the LN2 dewar before transfer. Followed by transferring liquid helium by
er Tom. The safety locks inside the cryostat to prevent shipping damage are also seen.

Tiling work done. Now for neoprene walls. The smaller square next to the pit is a solid RCC block for the Atomic Force Microscope.
