At the SpinLab I had access to a 2″ cryostat capable of cooling down to sub 2K, and it was equipped with a 3-axis vector magnet.

With the help of local machinists, I developed a few odd probes compatible with this cryostat as well as with a 1″ PPMS cryostat belonging to a neighbor.

## Design Principles : Fairly Straightforward

* Make a CAD render using SolidWorks.

* Start with a standard 2″ flange.  

* Machine a hole in the center and attach an SS tube of appropriate length via a custom built mating piece. 

* Add twisted pairs of high guage copper wires. 

* Seal with Stycast.

* Make a distribution box. 

* Start coding.
